<h2 align="center">Privacy and Policy</h2>
<p>
Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data our processes, how we processes it, and for what purposes.
<br>
We offers a wide range of products, including server products used to help operate enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host what’s next. References to our products in this statement include our service, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices.
<br>
Please read the product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. This statement applies to the interactions Microsoft has with you and the our products listed below, as well as other ATI Kegalle that display this statement.
<br>
Young people may prefer starting with the Privacy for young people page. That page highlights information that may be helpful for young people.
<br>
We collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with ati kegalle and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.
<br>
If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from SLIATE, please see the teachers and students products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data. If you are an end user of a ATI Kegalle or a SLIATE account provided by your usage, please see the Products provided by your purpose and the SLIATE account sections for more information.
<br>
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; 
or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.
